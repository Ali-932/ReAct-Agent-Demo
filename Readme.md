## üß† How ReAct Agents Work

### Step Structure



### Conceptual Framework

The ReAct pattern (Reason-Act-Observe) follows a cognitive loop inspired by human problem-solving strategies:

1. **Reason**: The agent analyzes information, evaluates options, and forms hypotheses about what actions to take next
2. **Act**: Based on reasoning, the agent selects and executes a specific Tool or action
3. **Observe**: The agent examines the results of the action to update its understanding
4. **Loop**: This cycle repeats until the task is complete

### Implementation Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Thought\nCreate Plan]
    B --> C[Act\nExecute Tool]
    C --> D[Observe\nProcess Result]
    D --> B
```

### Decision Architecture

Each REACT step includes:

- **Status**: Current workflow state (`FINISHED`, `IN-PROGRESS`, or `UNABLE TO PROCESS USER REQUEST`)
- **Observation**: Results from previous tool calls
- **Thought**: Reasoning for the next action
- **Confidence**: Model's certainty level (0.0-1.0)
- **Iteration**: Current step number
- **Tool-call**: Formatted API call with appropriate arguments


### Complete Execution Diagram

```mermaid

    UserReq[User Request] --> Agent
    
    subgraph Agent[ReAct Agent]
        Reason[Reason\nIteration n] --> Act[Act\nTool Call]
        Act --> Observe[Observe\nProcess Tool Response]
        Observe --> Reason
    end
    
    Agent --> FinalResp[Final Response]
    
    subgraph db_tools[Database tools]
        list_tables[list_tables]
        list_schema[list_schema]
        check_sql[check_sql]
        execute_sql[execute_sql]
  end
  subgraph spatial_tools[Spatial tools]
        calc[calculate_distance]
    end

   db_tools --- DB[Database Layer]
   spatial_tools --- SP[Spatial Layer]
```

### Output State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initial: User Query
    Initial --> Reasoning: Process Query
    Reasoning --> Action: Select Tool
    Action --> Observation: Execute Tool
    Observation --> Decision
    
    Decision --> Reasoning: More Steps Needed
    Decision --> Terminal: Task Complete
    
    state Terminal {
        [*] --> FINISHED: Success
        [*] --> UNABLE_TO_PROCESS: Failure
    }
```
### Output Schema

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "iteration": {"type": "integer"},
      "observation": {"type": "string"},
      "thought": {"type": "string"},
      "confidence": {"type": "number"},
      "status": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["IN-PROGRESS", "FINISHED", "UNABLE TO PROCESS USER REQUEST"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This architecture allows the agent to tackle complex multi-step problems by breaking them down into manageable subproblems and systematically working toward solutions.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- Verify your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

**Database Errors**
- Run `python setup/populate_db.py` again to reset the database
- Check for error messages during database initialization

**Tool Call Failures**
- Verify network connectivity
- Check that your prompt follows expected format
